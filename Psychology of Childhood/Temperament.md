Individual differences in behaviour, emotion, activity level, that are exhibited across context and theorised to be innate

Buss & Plomin (1987) -temperament is a set of inherited persoanlity traits that appear early in life, genetic in origin and appearing during the first year of life

**Three main approaches**
1. Between-person, or Pediatric, approach Thomas and Chess (1977)
	- Temperament is viewed as the "How" of behaviour, concerning the way the individual behaves. Uses clusters to categorise children
	- Activity Level
	- Regularity
	- Approach-Withdrawl
	- Adaptability
	- Threshold of responsiveness
	- Reaction intensity
	- Quality of mood
	- Distractability
	- Attention Span

2. Within-person approach Rothbart et al (2001)
	- Fear
	- Distress or anger
	- attention span 
	- Activity level
	- Smiling and laughter

3. Personality Tradition (Diamond; Buss & Plomin, 1984)
	- Strongest evidence for genetic basis of Emotionality, Activity and Sociability traits



- Saudino (2005) has consistently found that Monozygote (identical) twins are more similar than Dyzygotic (fraternal) twins, across these dimensions (Pasadenaa)
	- Positive affect
	- Attention/Persistence
	- Sociability
	- Activity
	- Distress
	- Emotionality
	- Negative affect
	- Approach
	- Adaptability
