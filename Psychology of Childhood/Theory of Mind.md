1. Mirror Neurons: brain cells that activate when a person does an action, but also if they see the other person performing the same action
2. Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) seem to be parts most responsible for theory of mind

- Wellman, Cross & Watson (2001)
	- Rapid development of false belief scores between age 3 and 5, 50% pass at 44 months, 75% at 56 months

- Hughes et al (2000), De Rosnay, et al (2008) - aggressive behaviour shows stronger links with poor self-control/emotion-regulations than it does with ToM

- Sutton, Smith and Swettenham (1999) - bullies had higher mean scores for theory of mind than other groups
