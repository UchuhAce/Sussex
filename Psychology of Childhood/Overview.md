**Study of Developmental Psychology**
-Usually observing or measuring children's behaviour
- Observing behavioural changes over time 
 [^1: so probably longitudinal]
- The study aims to do two things
	- Describe what develops
	- Explain how developments happen

**Key areas of child development** 
- Routinely distinguishes/needs to distinguish between *multiple aspects of development* SPICE:
	- Social e.g gender roles, friendships
	- Physical e.g Reflexes, motor skills
	- Innate/Genetic e.g temperament, nature & nurture
	- Cognitive and Communicative e.g senses, language, reasoning
	- Emotional e.g childhood disorders, caregiver relationship

**Explaining Development**
Theory needs to be able to *predict change* and *explain how* the change has occurred and needs to be able to answer:

- Causes of development e.g nature, nurture
- Why individual differences exist
- Whether child is active or passive (receiver)
- Continuous develipment or jumps
- Critical periods?
- Universal or variation across cultures

**Developmental Methods, Designs and Applications**
- Interviews
- Questionnaires
- Observations
- Thought experiments/Hypothetical Scenarios
- Lab tests and tasks

In order to predict change across age groups #DevelopmentalStages , but also within age groups #IndividualDifferences
- #Cross_sectional_designs 
	- Compare chldren of different age groups
	- Useful for identifying differences across age  groups
	- doesn't explain how development occurred nor does it tell us about individual differences
- #Longitudinal_Study
- Follows children over time e.g child of our time
- Reveals patterns of change
- Helps explain stability of individual differences

**Applications**
- Health, physical and mental
- Education
- Policy Development and LAw
- Social Work and Family Services

**Connected fields of study**
- Biology
- Education
- Anthropology
- Neuroscience
- Sociology
