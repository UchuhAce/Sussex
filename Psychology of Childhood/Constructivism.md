Synthesis of nature and nurture
- Children actively cxonstruct knowledge through interactions witht hte environment, bottom down model because mental models created from outside world

Piaget
- Children progress in stages
	- Invariant order
	- Logical thought is qualitatively different in each of the stages
	1. Sensorimotor - 0-2 - understands world through senses and actions
	2. Preoperational - 2-7 - understands world through language and mental images - egocentrism
	3. Concrete operational - 7-12 - understands world through logical thinking and categories
	4. Formal operational - 12+ - understands world through hypothetical thinking and scientific reasoning

- Object permanence - awareness of hidden objects from 8+ months

- Limitations:
	- Infants and young children are more cognitively competent
	- Not enough explanation on mechanisms that allow schemas to develop
	- Stage model more consistent than reality
	- Does not give enough consideration to factor of the social environment
