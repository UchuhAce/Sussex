**Triad of Impairment (Characteristics)**)

1. Social interaction
	- Difficulty understanding other people and recognising their emotions
2. Social Comunication
	- Difficulties interpreting language both verbal and non-verbal, ranging from no speech to limited or not understanding jokes
3. Repetitive Behaviours
	- Prefer routine/predictability
	- Prefer to eat same food, travel same way
	- May have focused interests

Baxter et al (2015) - worldwide prevalence around 1%, but highly variable

Core triad may be similar but other areas in girls Holtmann et al (2007) e.g restricted interests, attention problems

#Biology 
- Autism has a prenatal origin related to risk but precise cause has not been determined
- Highly heritable (but not 100%)

#Cognitive 
- Bias away from integrating contextual information for meaning (detail focus)
- Theory of mind deficits 
- Executive Dysfunction 
	- May be necessary for development of Theory of Mind Ozonoff, (1991)

#Treatment/Intervention 
- Lovaas (1987) improvments could be made if ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis) treatment provided early enough
	- 47% achieved "normal intellectual and educational functioning" versus 2% of control group - suggests that it is malleable or environmental causes
