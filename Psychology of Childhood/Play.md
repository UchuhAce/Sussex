Rubin et al, four dimensions of play
1. Joyful
2. Autonomous
3. Means over ends (this is the most important)
4. Spontaeneous


Play is important because
- Children form non caregiver/receiver based relationships with peers and adults for the first time (Dunn, 1983, Schaffer & Emerson, 1964)
- by 2-3 years toddlers discriminate among peer partners (Howe, 1983, Ross & Lollis, 1989), by 3-4 engage in more skilful interactions and use these skills to access a wider range of playmates 
- Well acquainted toddler peers are able to engage in scripted co-op fantasy play before 24 months of age, Howes and Mattheson (1992), one aspect of play is to represent preoccupations and things they do not have the tools yet to express themselves in conversation
