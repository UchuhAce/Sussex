#MentalHealth 

Polanczyk (2015) - Worldwide prevalence is around 3.4%
- 25-50% will continue with diagnosis until adulthood, but many more have ADHD in partial remission
 
 #Biology based theories
 - Genetic
	 - Highly heritable, with dopamine receptor gene (D4) showing most evidence
 - Dopamine and noradrenaline system disregulation
 - Hypoarousal hypthesis (not unique to ADHD)
	 - Stimuli not sufficiently arousing, so behaviour is stimulus seeking

#Psychosocial theories
- Executive function
	- Impaired behavioural inhibition
- Family/systemic factors
	- High stress and low support
	- Less "effective" parenting, conflict, comorbidity (Babinski)
- Environmental risk factors (e.g alcohol, smoking in poregnancy)


#Treatment/Intervention
**Medication**
- Van Der Oord et al (2008) - generally produce moderate effect sizes for symptom reduction

**Psychological Treatment**
- Some support for psychological interventions particularly behavioural therapy, Catala Lopez (2017) and Fabiano et al (2009), but not other methods
